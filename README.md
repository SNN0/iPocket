\# iPocket: Dynamic Pocket Prediction in Molecular Dynamics Simulations



This project contains the code for \*\*iPocket\*\*, a machine learning model designed to predict protein pocket dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The iPocket model goes beyond traditional static analyses, aiming to provide a deeper, more dynamic understanding of protein function and the transient nature of binding sites.



\## Project Goal



The primary objective of the iPocket model is to treat proteins not just as static structures but as dynamic systems. By analyzing the structural changes that occur throughout a simulation, the framework seeks to provide novel insights into how proteins function and interact with potential drug molecules.



\## Key Features



\* \*\*A Novel Approach:\*\* Utilizes a unique framework that treats proteins as a dynamic graph, capturing complex relationships between atoms or residues over time.

\* \*\*Hybrid Architecture:\*\* Employs an innovative neural network architecture designed to learn both the spatial relationships and the temporal dependencies present in simulation data.

\* \*\*Rich Feature Engineering:\*\* Leverages a robust feature extraction pipeline to derive meaningful molecular and topological features from MD trajectories.

\* \*\*Dynamic Prediction:\*\* The model is trained to predict the locations of potential binding pockets at each time step, offering critical insights into their formation and disappearance.



This repository will be updated soon with the full code, data loaders, and training scripts.
